# Basic responsive design principle

  ## Fluid Layouts
    - to allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width (or even height)
    - Use %(or vh/vw) unit instead pf px for elements that should adapt to viewport (usually layouts)
    - Use max-width instead of width

  ## Responsive units
    - use rem unit instead of px for most lengths
    - to make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically

  ## Flexible Images
    - by default, images don't scale automatically as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that
    - always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width property

  ## Media queries
    - to change css styles on certain viewport widths (called breakpoints)  


# Layout type
